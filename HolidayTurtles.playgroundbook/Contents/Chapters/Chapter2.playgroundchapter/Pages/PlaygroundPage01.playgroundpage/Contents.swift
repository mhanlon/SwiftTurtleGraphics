 # Get in the Holiday Spirit
 **Goal**: Decorate an Egg!
 
 For Easter, we're going to color a few eggs. But first we've got to draw them. We use a little function we've written to draw our eggs on the screen.
 
 We exercise our new found use of instances of turtles (in the live sessions: https://www.twitch.tv/thecodehub).
 
 Try decorating our eggs. Or add some more. Play with the pen size and colors, if you like.
